# Data Structures and Algo más ...

This repo contains exercises driven to learn common techniques to solve software interview problems. Each folder can contain several versions for the same exercise. Each version has a different approach to solving the same problem in order to explore workarounds.

I'm following these two guides: [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) and [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). These websites take their exercises from leetcode. You can see my leetcode profile [here](https://leetcode.com/jsparadac/).

Note: In my country :colombia:, several commerces have a signboard that says "y algo más..." which means "And something else...". You know, adding sort of mystery I guess. So, this title is just a word game with algo...rithms.
